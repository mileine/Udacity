The second project from [Udacity - Front End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) is a Memory Game.

### How to play :video_game:

Steps to play:
1. Click on a card.
2. A picture will be displayed.
3. Click on a second card:
 * If the pictures on both cards match, they will turn green.  
 * If the pictures don't match, the cards will turn red and flip back.
4. The game will continue until all cards that match are open.
5. As the number of moves increases, the player lose points, which will be indicated by the number of stars displayed on the score board.
6. When the game is won, a message will be displayed. The player can click on "Play Again" for new match or on "Close" to go back to the deck.
